  <h2>I got hired</h2>
  <p>this massive fragger came at me today. <br>
  Was damn close to busting his face in right then and there. <br>
  Something 'bout his look, his stride, just got my circuits sparking. <br>

  A friggin' corpo scum, I knew it. <br> 
  I can sniff those chromeheads from a klick away. <br>
  He goes by AU, but I already dug up his real handle ///<br>
  He babbled alot, said he's slaving away for some small-time outfit<br> 
  Sentinel Solutions, a drekkin' contract crew for odd gigs. <br>
  And the mofo needed a netrunner. <br>
  
  Considering I've already been carving out a rep for myself,<br> 
  he figured I was the perfect fit.<br>
  Money talks, I guess...<br>
  And the gig itself lines up with a prime chance to screw with Arasaka.<br></p>
